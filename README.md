Technical exercise

[Backend] Rate-Limited Notification Service
We have a Notification system that sends out email notifications of various types (status update, daily news, project invitations, etc). We need to protect recipients from getting too many emails, either due to system errors or due to abuse, so let’s limit the number of emails sent to them by implementing a rate-limited version of NotificationService.
The system must reject requests that are over the limit.
Some sample notification types and rate limit rules, e.g.:

Status: not more than 2 per minute for each recipient
News: not more than 1 per day for each recipient
Marketing: not more than 3 per hour for each recipient
Etc. these are just samples, the system might have several rate limit rules!

NOTES:

Your solution will be evaluated on code quality, clarity and development best practices. 
Take into account that this is the initial assessment of the work quality that you can produce in a productive environment so show your best face.
Feel free to use the programming language, frameworks, technologies, etc that you feel more comfortable with.
Below you'll find a code snippet that can serve as a guidance of one of the implementation alternatives in Java. Feel free to use it if you find it useful or ignore it otherwise; it is not required to use it at all nor translate this code to your programming language.

Please share with us the link of the repository containing the application source code when finished and let us know to schedule the meeting to review the app.
Feel free to ping me any question you might have about this technical assessment.
